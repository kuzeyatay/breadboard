"""Mechanical backstop for the anti-polling / no-raw-log-dumping policy.

`build_coding_progress_reporting_policy` declares `timed_polling_rejected` and
`raw_log_dumping_rejected`, but declarative text loses to a supervising agent
under pressure. This module keeps a small local ledger of how many bytes each
run's observe/show surfaces have already emitted into agent context. Past the
budget the surfaces degrade to summary-only output plus artifact pointers, so
the policy becomes mechanically true instead of aspirational.

The ledger is local, metadata-only, and best-effort: a ledger write failure
never blocks an observation surface.
