"""OMH as a Hermes memory provider: the lane that runs without being called.

Everything OMH knew about memory used to require someone to ask. `omh memory
status` had the comparison, the `omh_memory` tool had it after PR #672, and both
waited for a question. Meanwhile Hermes' own memory kept being written by
``agent/background_review.py``, which forks after each turn and decides for
itself what to save -- with nothing telling it what OMH already holds, what is
duplicated, or how little room is left.

Hermes exposes the seam for this and OMH was not standing in it.
``plugins/memory/__init__.py`` scans ``$HERMES_HOME/plugins/<name>/`` as well as
its own bundled directory, which is where the OMH bundle already installs, and
``agent/memory_provider.py`` defines the lifecycle. Four of its hooks are the
ones that matter here:

- ``prefetch``       -- runs before every API call, so recall arrives unasked
- ``on_pre_compress``-- runs before compression discards messages
- ``on_memory_write``-- runs when Hermes writes its own memory, giving provenance
- ``on_session_end`` -- runs at a session boundary, where consolidation belongs

No tool schemas are exposed. ``memory_provider.py`` gives tool-schema bloat as
the reason only one external provider may run at a time, and OMH already
registers ten tools through the plugin path; the on-demand block read belongs on
``omh_memory``, which exists, rather than on a second registration path that
Hermes gates behind toolset config.

OMH still makes no model call and still cannot write Hermes memory. This
provider reads OMH's own store, renders it, and records what it saw.
