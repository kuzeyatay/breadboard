"""Cross-session in-flight unit markers (`omh_inflight_marker/v1`).

Local dispatch of a fanout unit is blocking: `_dispatch_unit` calls the runner
and waits, so the dispatching process cannot report on itself and no second
session can see that a unit is currently occupying a worktree. A marker file
written before the spawn and removed after it is the whole mechanism — one
small JSON object per in-flight unit, under the fanout directory that already
holds that fanout's contract and dispatch summary.

Boundaries, in order of importance:

- Presence is not liveness. A marker only proves that some process wrote it
  and has not removed it. A crashed or killed dispatcher leaves the marker
  behind, and nothing here can tell "still running" from "died holding the
  file". `read_inflight_markers` therefore reports `started_at` and a fixed
  `liveness: "unknown"`, and never emits a "stale" or "running" verdict — age
  is the caller's arithmetic against its own threshold, not this module's
  guess.
- Never raise at the clear or read boundary. `clear_inflight_marker` is meant
  for a `finally:` block where raising would mask the real dispatch failure,
  so it swallows a missing file, a bad id, and any OS error and returns False.
  `read_inflight_markers` skips what it cannot parse instead of failing the
  whole listing.
- Metadata only, flat and scalar. Every persisted value is a string: owner,
  host, routed model and effort, run ref, worktree path, timestamps. No
  prompts, no output, no nested objects, no floats — the setup-profile
  correct/restore path drops non-scalar nested values.
- Reuse the existing fanout directory convention. Marker storage hangs off
  `fanout_artifacts._managed_fanout_dir`, the same containment-validated
  helper that resolves `paths.fanout_contracts_dir / <fanout_id>` for the
  contract and dispatch summary. No parallel layout, no second id validator.
- Reporting only. An in-flight marker is dispatch bookkeeping. It is not
  result, review, CI, merge-readiness, or merge evidence.
