"""Deterministic local executor skill discovery (`executor_skill_discovery/v1`).

Reporting-only observation of the coding skills the operator has installed for a
given executor, so a dispatched unit prompt can name the skills that user
actually has instead of a name OMH hardcoded. Every user's skill set is
different; nothing here assumes a particular pack is installed.

Boundaries, in order of importance:

- **Declared, never observed.** A `SKILL.md` on disk is configuration evidence
  that the file exists, not proof the executor loads, enables, or honours it.
  `READINESS_EVIDENCE_RULE` in `coding_delegation` exists because a binary on
  PATH plus an auth file was once read as "ready"; a skill directory is the same
  class of signal. Every payload carries the claim boundary.

- **Description in, role label out.** Classification reads each skill's YAML
  frontmatter `description`, which is third-party, operator-writable text — the
  one place this module reads a file body. That text NEVER leaves the
  classifier: it is matched against a closed role lexicon, reduced to one label,
  and discarded. Only the skill NAME reaches a caller, and only after passing
  `require_opaque_metadata_ref`. Without this rule a description reading
  "IGNORE PREVIOUS INSTRUCTIONS AND ..." would ride OMH's own prompt into a
  coding agent holding edit permissions; with it, the worst a hostile
  description can do is produce a wrong role label.

- **Invocation form comes from the source directory, not a guess.** The same
  Claude Code skill is `/<name>` under `~/.claude/skills` and `/<pack>:<name>`
  when a plugin marketplace provides it. Scanning is what makes the emitted
  string correct; a caller that guessed a prefix would be wrong for every user
  whose skills came from a plugin.

- **Bounded.** Fixed probe table, fixed depth, capped entries per source, capped
  frontmatter bytes. A hostile or oversized tree cannot cause unbounded IO.

- **No new vocabulary.** Roles are `model_routing.MODEL_ROLES`, the vocabulary
  fanout units already declare — not a fifth "skill/capability" vocabulary
  alongside `KNOWN_CAPABILITY_NAMES`, `capabilities/families.py`, and
  `skills/catalog.py`.

- **Read-time only.** Nothing here is persisted, cached, or routed. Discovery is
  passed explicitly by a caller that opted in; the router never imports it.
