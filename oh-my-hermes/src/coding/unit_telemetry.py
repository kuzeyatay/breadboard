"""Deterministic unit telemetry read from a spawned coding CLI's stdout (`omh_unit_telemetry/v1`).

`omh coding fanout dispatch` spawns a local agent CLI per unit and keeps only a
bounded stdout tail in memory. When that CLI was asked for a structured stream,
the tail carries the two numbers a fanout status board otherwise has to print as
"unknown": how many tokens the run consumed, and which provider-side session it
belongs to. This module lifts exactly those out and nothing else.

Relationship to `codex_progress` (read this before "fixing" either module):

    `codex_progress._TOKEN_USAGE_KEYS` strips `input_tokens`, `output_tokens`,
    `total_tokens` and friends out of the text it collects. That is correct
    there and must stay: that module builds VISIBLE narration text, and an
    accounting blob swept into a human-facing summary reads as executor
    activity it never was ("Background process ... usage ..." noise). This
    module reads the same key names for the opposite purpose -- as INTEGERS
    into a metadata-only counter. It emits no free text at all: every value it
    returns is an int or an opaque, whitespace-free identifier. Widening
    `codex_progress` to keep tokens would leak accounting into narration;
    narrowing this module to drop them would delete the only real numbers the
    board has. Neither is a bug in the other.

Boundaries, in order of importance:

- Never fabricate. A value the CLI did not report is an ABSENT KEY, never a
  zero. The renderer prints "unknown" for absent; a fabricated `0` would read
  as a real observation of a run that used no tokens. Nothing here estimates,
  infers, or sums partial counts into a total the CLI did not itself report --
  Claude's result object reports input and output but no total, so
  `tokens_total` is simply absent for that owner.
- Pure and deterministic. `parse_unit_telemetry` performs no file I/O, no clock
  read, no environment read, and no network call; the same `(owner, stdout_text)`
  always yields the same payload. It never raises: a truncated, interleaved, or
  pathological stream returns `parsed=False`.
- Metadata only. Token counts and an opaque session identifier are the whole
  surface. Prompts, assistant text, diffs, file paths, and error text are never
  read into the payload; a candidate session ref containing whitespace or
  unprintable characters is free text, not an identifier, and is rejected.
- Honest absence over invented coverage. Owners with no structured stdout
  surface (`omo-runtime` and its pi/senpi/opencode hosts) report
  `parsed=False`, `source="none"`. That is the required answer, not a gap to
  close later with heuristic text scraping.
- Reporting only. Telemetry is an observation of what a CLI printed. It is not
  billing truth, not provider-side accounting, and never execution-result,
  verification, review, CI, merge-readiness, or merge evidence.
