"""Per-family capability enable/disable policy (`omh_capability_policy/v1`).

OMH ships 101 installable skills behind one binary install lever: `core` (9
skills) or `full` (all 101). There is no middle, so a user who wants the
coding handoff surface but not the memory surface has to take both. This
module adds the middle at the unit users already see -- the six capability
families in `families.py` -- so one family can be turned off without
uninstalling OMH and without touching the other five.

Boundaries, in order of importance:

- `CORE_SKILLS` are never disableable. They are the floor `omh doctor` checks
  for; removing them turns a deliberate opt-out into a broken install.
- The policy records which surfaces this install OFFERS. It never disables
  Hermes itself, never claims a skill was uninstalled, and is not execution,
  review, CI, or merge evidence.
- Every persisted value is a scalar or a list of scalars. Nested dicts and
  floats are dropped by the setup-profile correct/restore path, so a policy
  that used them would silently lose fields on the next repair.
- Absent policy means all six families enabled. An install that predates this
  feature keeps working unchanged, and `build_capability_policy()` with no
  arguments is the same thing written down.
