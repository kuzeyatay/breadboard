"""Accept rendered `omh-` display names as canonical names during routing.

Wrapper chat bodies render installable skills with their `omh-` display label so
the prose matches the host's own `Reading skill omh-<name>` status line. Users
echo that label straight back ("use omh-visual-qa"), so routing matching has to
resolve the display form to the same workflow as the canonical form.

This module is deliberately pure text: callers pass the display-to-canonical
mapping they already know, so the plugin bundle can reuse it without importing
the skill catalog.
