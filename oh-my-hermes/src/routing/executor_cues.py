    Plain containment is wrong for the omo-runtime phrase family: "api한테"
    contains "pi한테", "promo runtime" contains "omo runtime", and "raspi
    status" contains "pi status". An occurrence only counts here when the
    character immediately before the match is absent or non-alphanumeric --
    `str.isalnum()` is True for Hangul (and its NFKD jamo), so "라즈베리pi한테"
    is rejected the same way "raspi" is -- and the character immediately after
    the match is absent or not an ASCII alphanumeric. The trailing check is
    deliberately ASCII-only: Korean particles attach directly to the right of a
    Latin name ("opencode로", "omo runtime으로", "senpi가"), so a Hangul
    continuation after the phrase is a particle naming the agent, while an
    ASCII continuation ("opencodes") is a longer word that never named it.

    Callers must pass `text` and `phrases` through the same fold
    (`normalized_phrase` on routing surfaces, plain lowering in coding
    delegation); this helper compares them verbatim.
