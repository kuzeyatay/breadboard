"""Measure routing accuracy, not routing regression.

Every existing routing gate answers "did behaviour change?". None answers "is it
right?". That is how a suite of routing tests stayed green while ordinary
requests misrouted: the expectations encoded whatever the router already did.

This gate asks the other question. It runs the same six intents in six
languages and scores each turn against the workflow a competent reader would
pick, so a change can be shown to have moved accuracy rather than merely
preserved behaviour. Running one intent set across languages is deliberate: it
makes the coverage gap legible instead of averaging it away.

Outcomes per case:

- `resolved`      dispatched to the expected workflow
- `handed_off`    undecided, but the candidate handoff shortlists the expected
                  workflow, so model selection can still land it
- `missed`        neither
- `high_confidence_misroute` dispatched to the wrong workflow at high
                  confidence. This is the worst failure mode: no picker and no
                  handoff rescues the user, so it carries its own ceiling.

Note that Spanish is Latin script and therefore reported as trigger-backed by
`routing/input_language.py`, while the trigger tables are English. Latin script
is not the same thing as English, and this corpus is what makes that visible.
