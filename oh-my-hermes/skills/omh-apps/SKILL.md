# Connector Operator

This is a Hermes-native `connector-operator` workflow skill.

## Why This Exists

`connector-operator` exists so Hermes users can ask for this workflow in chat and receive a structured, evidence-bounded OMH operating surface instead of ad hoc narration.

## Do Not Use When

- The request is already handled by a narrower explicit skill with stronger evidence.
- The user asks OMH to secretly run external platforms, connectors, schedulers, file exports, or runtime agents.
- The only safe answer is to ask for missing authority, credentials, target, or observed evidence first.

## Examples

Good example:

- Prompt: connector-operator draft an email to the customer and prepare a confirmation gate before sending.
- Expected behavior: Produce `prepare_connector_operator_card` with required context, wrapper actions, and not-evidence boundaries.
- Why: The prompt names a real workflow surface that Hermes can orchestrate without hiding execution.

Bad example:

- Prompt: connector-operator send the Jira update with hidden credentials and claim it was delivered.
- Expected behavior: Report the missing observed evidence or authority instead of claiming the external step happened.
- Why: Prepared OMH guidance is not platform, runtime, connector, file, memory, or delivery evidence.

## Completion Checklist

- Provider, target object, allowed action, payload summary, authority, confirmation policy, and stop condition are explicit.
- Credentials, missing connector setup, external writes, sends, ticket mutations, calendar invites, CRM updates, and webhook delivery are gated or marked missing.
- Message ids, ticket ids, provider responses, delivery receipts, and API effects are reported only from observed connector evidence.

## Recovery Notes

- If the connector, credentials, or permission is missing, route to toolbelt-readiness before preparing action success claims.
- If the request is only chat thread delivery policy for Discord, Slack, or Telegram, route to gateway-intent-card instead.
- If the external app action would create, send, invite, mutate, or delete provider state, require an explicit confirmation gate.

## Workflow Lane

- Current lane: **Automation and status** (`achievements`, `workspace-audit`, `production-audit`, `automation-blueprint`, `github-event-ops`, `agent-board`, `gateway-intent-card`, `voice-operator`, `+33 more`) - schedules, status, health, and ops review.
- If intent belongs to another lane, hand back to `oh-my-hermes` or name the adjacent workflow.
- Shared product, routing, compatibility, and evidence rules: `omh-routing/references/skill-common-rail.md`.

## Use When

Use when Hermes should prepare or supervise a provider-backed external app action without claiming connector availability, credentials, API mutation, delivery, or success.

    Strong routing signals: `connector-operator`, `connector operator`, `external app action`, `external connector action`, `saas action`, `api action`, `send email`, `email customer`, `gmail draft`, `gmail send`, `create linear ticket`, `create linear issue`, `linear ticket`, `linear issue`, `update linear`, `jira ticket`, `jira issue`, `create jira issue`, `open jira ticket`, `create jira`, `notion page`, `update notion`, `crm update`, `salesforce update`, `hubspot update`, `create calendar event`, `calendar invite`, `google calendar`, `send slack dm`, `slack dm`, `discord dm`, `post to discord`, `post to slack`, `discord post`, `slack post`, `connector action`, `이메일 보내`, `이메일 발송`, `메일 보내`, `gmail 초안`, `linear ticket`, `linear 티켓`, `linear 이슈`, `jira 티켓`, `jira 이슈`, `notion 페이지`, `노션 페이지`, `캘린더 초대`, `외부 앱`, `외부 커넥터`, `커넥터 액션`

## Catalog Metadata

Category: `connector`
Phase: `connector-task`
Hermes role: `guide`
Quality tier: `workflow-surface-gated`
Reasoning demand: `standard`

Quality bar:

- Name the user-facing workflow objective, required context, next action, and stop condition.
- Separate prepared guidance from observed platform, runtime, connector, file, memory, or delivery evidence.
- Expose missing tools, credentials, targets, or observations as user-visible gaps.

Handoff policy:

Keep this as Hermes-facing orchestration guidance first. Prepare executor, connector, gateway, or host-runtime handoff only when the user accepts that next step and observed evidence can be recorded.

Required inputs:

- user request
- target context
- delivery or status expectation
- known missing evidence

Expected outputs:

- connector_task_card/v1
- connector_scope/v1
- connector_auth_boundary/v1
- connector_confirmation_gate/v1 when mutating or sending
- connector_result_manifest/v1 when observed
- next action
- prepared-vs-observed boundary

Artifact expectations:

- connector_task_card/v1 metadata-only wrapper card when prepared
- connector_scope/v1 with provider, target object, allowed action, payload summary, and stop condition
- connector_auth_boundary/v1 separating missing connector, missing credentials, user-supplied authority, and credential-use prohibition
- connector_confirmation_gate/v1 for sending, ticket mutation, external write, webhook delivery, CRM/database update, or irreversible provider action
- connector_result_manifest/v1 only when provider response, message id, ticket id, API transcript, or delivery receipt is observed

Safety rules:

- A connector operator card is not connector availability, credential validation, API call, message send, ticket creation, ticket update, database/CRM mutation, external write, webhook delivery, or provider success evidence unless observed connector-result evidence records it.
- Do not claim connector, gateway, runtime, file generation, memory mutation, or host automation evidence from prepared guidance.

## Runtime Evidence

Preferred harness for this skill: `connector-operator`.

```sh
omh runtime record --skill connector-operator --harness connector-operator --status started
```

Record observed delegation results; otherwise return `not_available` or `not_observed`.
Prepared OMH routing is not execution, review, CI, merge-readiness, or merge evidence.
- Treat wrapper memory/context summaries as advisory local context, not proof of opaque Hermes memory reads or changes.
Preserve workflow intent and stop conditions; verify before claiming completion.

Use Hermes-native subagent/delegation features when available: native subagents -> Hermes delegation when available, otherwise sequential lanes.

Shared product, compatibility, topology, memory, harness, and execution rules: `omh-routing/references/skill-common-rail.md`. Load it when applicable; otherwise name an unavailable capability.
