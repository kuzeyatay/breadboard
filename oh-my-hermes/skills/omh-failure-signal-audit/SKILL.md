# Failure Signal Audit

This is a Hermes-native `failure-signal-audit` workflow skill.

## Why This Exists

`failure-signal-audit` exists so Hermes users can ask for this workflow in chat and receive a structured, evidence-bounded OMH operating surface instead of ad hoc narration.

## Do Not Use When

- The request is already handled by a narrower explicit skill with stronger evidence.
- The user asks OMH to secretly run external platforms, connectors, schedulers, file exports, or runtime agents.
- The only safe answer is to ask for missing authority, credentials, target, or observed evidence first.

## Examples

Good example:

- Prompt: failure-signal-audit check this frontend and agent trace for swallowed errors, false green status, and dangerous fallbacks.
- Expected behavior: Produce `prepare_failure_signal_audit` with required context, wrapper actions, and not-evidence boundaries.
- Why: The prompt names a real workflow surface that Hermes can orchestrate without hiding execution.

Bad example:

- Prompt: failure-signal-audit silently patch every catch block and claim the system is reliable now.
- Expected behavior: Report the missing observed evidence or authority instead of claiming the external step happened.
- Why: Prepared OMH guidance is not platform, runtime, connector, file, memory, or delivery evidence.

## Completion Checklist

- Audit scope, source surfaces, and evidence types are named.
- Swallowed errors, dangerous fallbacks, propagation gaps, and false-green claims are reported as separate finding types.
- Each finding names location or evidence ref, severity, user/operator impact, and a smallest safe remediation route.
- No remediation, runtime repair, verification, CI, merge, or future reliability claim is made without observed follow-up evidence.

## Recovery Notes

- If no code/trace/runtime evidence is supplied, prepare the audit plan and request the smallest source surface to inspect.
- If the user wants live service SLO or incident review, route to reliability-review.
- If the user wants rendered browser proof, route frontend visual evidence to visual-qa before PASS.

## Workflow Lane

- Current lane: **Automation and status** (`achievements`, `workspace-audit`, `production-audit`, `automation-blueprint`, `github-event-ops`, `agent-board`, `gateway-intent-card`, `voice-operator`, `+33 more`) - schedules, status, health, and ops review.
- If intent belongs to another lane, hand back to `oh-my-hermes` or name the adjacent workflow.
- Shared product, routing, compatibility, and evidence rules: `omh-routing/references/skill-common-rail.md`.

## Use When

Use when Hermes should audit code, frontend/browser behavior, agent traces, or runtime reports for failures that were swallowed, downgraded, hidden by fallbacks, or reported as green without enough evidence.

    Strong routing signals: `failure-signal-audit`, `failure signal audit`, `silent failure`, `silent failures`, `silent failure hunter`, `swallowed error`, `swallowed errors`, `empty catch`, `ignored exception`, `hidden failure`, `hidden failures`, `dangerous fallback`, `bad fallback`, `fallback hides errors`, `missing error propagation`, `error propagation`, `console errors ignored`, `network failures ignored`, `false green`, `false pass`, `무음 실패`, `조용한 실패`, `숨은 실패`, `삼킨 에러`, `에러 삼킴`, `위험한 fallback`, `위험한 폴백`, `폴백이 에러 숨김`, `실패 신호 감사`, `실패 신호`

## Catalog Metadata

Category: `review`
Phase: `failure-signal-audit`
Hermes role: `reviewer`
Quality tier: `workflow-surface-gated`
Reasoning demand: `standard`

Quality bar:

- Name the user-facing workflow objective, required context, next action, and stop condition.
- Separate prepared guidance from observed platform, runtime, connector, file, memory, or delivery evidence.
- Expose missing tools, credentials, targets, or observations as user-visible gaps.

Handoff policy:

Keep this as Hermes-facing orchestration guidance first. Prepare executor, connector, gateway, or host-runtime handoff only when the user accepts that next step and observed evidence can be recorded.

Required inputs:

- user request
- target context
- delivery or status expectation
- known missing evidence

Expected outputs:

- failure_signal_audit_plan/v1
- silent_failure_finding/v1 when observed
- fallback_risk_matrix/v1
- propagation_gap_map/v1
- false_green_status_review/v1
- remediation_handoff/v1 when needed

Artifact expectations:

- failure_signal_audit_plan/v1 with source boundary, surfaces, evidence types, and stop condition
- silent_failure_finding/v1 only from observed code, trace, console, network, test, or runtime evidence
- fallback_risk_matrix/v1 separating safe fallback, user-visible degraded mode, masked failure, and destructive fallback
- propagation_gap_map/v1 for missing context, lost stack, ignored async rejection, empty catch, null/empty default, or log-only handling
- false_green_status_review/v1 comparing PASS/green claims against observed checks and missing signals
- remediation_handoff/v1 only after findings are accepted and the selected owner is explicit

Safety rules:

- A failure signal audit is not remediation, code modification, runtime repair, console/network pass, incident closure, verification, review, CI, merge-readiness, merge, or proof that hidden failures no longer exist.
- Do not claim connector, gateway, runtime, file generation, memory mutation, or host automation evidence from prepared guidance.

## Runtime Evidence

Preferred harness for this skill: `failure-signal-audit`.

```sh
omh runtime record --skill failure-signal-audit --harness failure-signal-audit --status started
```

Record observed delegation results; otherwise return `not_available` or `not_observed`.
Prepared OMH routing is not execution, review, CI, merge-readiness, or merge evidence.
- Treat wrapper memory/context summaries as advisory local context, not proof of opaque Hermes memory reads or changes.
Preserve workflow intent and stop conditions; verify before claiming completion.

Use Hermes-native subagent/delegation features when available: native subagents -> Hermes delegation when available, otherwise sequential lanes.

Shared product, compatibility, topology, memory, harness, and execution rules: `omh-routing/references/skill-common-rail.md`. Load it when applicable; otherwise name an unavailable capability.
