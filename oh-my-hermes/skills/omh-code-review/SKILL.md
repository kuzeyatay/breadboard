# Code Review

This is a Hermes-native `code-review` workflow skill.

## Why This Exists

`code-review` exists to make review bug-first and evidence-grounded: findings must cite concrete files, diffs, commands, or artifacts before any summary or fix proposal.

## Do Not Use When

- The user asks to implement the fix rather than review existing code or claims.
- There is no diff, file set, claim, artifact, or expected behavior to review.
- The request is broad product critique, strategy, or planning rather than code or evidence review.

## Examples

Good example:

- Prompt: $code-review review this PR for install/update UX regressions and missing tests.
- Expected behavior: Lead with ranked findings, cite concrete evidence, then list open questions and test gaps.
- Why: The task is explicitly review-shaped and has a behavioral risk surface.

Bad example:

- Prompt: $code-review add the missing setup flag and commit it.
- Expected behavior: Route implementation to a selected executor/runtime after review findings are established.
- Why: Review can identify the issue, but code mutation is a separate execution step.

## Completion Checklist

- Findings come first and are ranked by severity before summary or praise.
- Every finding cites file, diff, command output, artifact, or expected behavior evidence.
- No-issue reviews still name residual risk, missing tests, and independent review evidence if unavailable.
- Fix implementation, architecture follow-up, and CI/merge claims stay separate from the review result.

## Recovery Notes

- If no diff, file set, PR, or artifact is available, inspect the requested target or ask one target question before reviewing.
- If tests fail or are missing, cite the exact command gap and do not approve the change as verified.
- If independent review evidence is unavailable, say so directly instead of implying a second reviewer passed it.

## Workflow Lane

- Current lane: **Coding handoff** (`idea-to-deploy`, `cto-loop`, `deploy-and-monitor`, `code-review`, `build-failure-triage`, `verification-gate`, `security-safety-review`, `ultrawork`, `+7 more`) - coding owners, handoffs, review, CI, and merge evidence.
- If intent belongs to another lane, hand back to `oh-my-hermes` or name the adjacent workflow.
- Shared product, routing, compatibility, and evidence rules: `omh-routing/references/skill-common-rail.md`.

## Use When

Use for review-shaped requests; findings come first and must cite concrete evidence.

    Strong routing signals: `code-review`, `$code-review`, `review`, `audit`, `find bugs`, `release gate`, `claim audit`, `evidence audit`, `README claim`, `what actually happened`, `code review`, `review gate`, `리뷰`, `코드 리뷰`, `리뷰까지`, `릴리즈 전`, `실제 코드와 맞는가`, `실제로 뭐 했는지`, `검증된 결과`

## Catalog Metadata

Category: `review`
Phase: `critique`
Hermes role: `reviewer`
Quality tier: `finding-evidence-gated`
Reasoning demand: `standard`

Quality bar:

- Lead with ranked findings grounded in file, diff, command, or artifact evidence.
- Separate review findings from fix implementation; fixes become executor work.
- For Hermes-owned coding work, inspect `hermes_coding_harness/v1` and require review evidence before upgrading the reviewer lane.
- Say clearly when no actionable issue is found and name remaining test gaps.

Handoff policy:

Hermes may frame and summarize review evidence; fixes or code mutations found during review should be delegated to the selected coding executor.

Required inputs:

- diff or files
- expected behavior
- test evidence

Expected outputs:

- ranked findings
- open questions
- test gaps

Artifact expectations:

- critic run record when review evidence is captured

Safety rules:

- Findings come before summaries.
- Cite concrete evidence for every finding.
- Say clearly when no issue is found.

## Runtime Evidence

Preferred harness for this skill: `critic`.

```sh
omh runtime record --skill code-review --harness critic --status started
```

Record observed delegation results; otherwise return `not_available` or `not_observed`.
Prepared OMH routing is not execution, review, CI, merge-readiness, or merge evidence.
- When wrapper metadata includes `memory_review_card/v1` or `handoff_context_pack/v1`, treat it as reviewed OMH-local or wrapper-supplied context only. Use conflict-free context summaries to shape plans and handoffs, but do not claim Hermes internal memory was read or changed.
Preserve workflow intent and stop conditions; verify before claiming completion.

Use Hermes-native subagent/delegation features when available: native subagents -> Hermes delegation when available, otherwise sequential lanes.

Shared product, compatibility, topology, memory, harness, and execution rules: `omh-routing/references/skill-common-rail.md`. Load it when applicable; otherwise name an unavailable capability.
