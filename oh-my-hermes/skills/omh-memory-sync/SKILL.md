description: [omh] English-canonical Hermes memory-review guidance: inspect USER.md and MEMORY.md claims and prepare a native write diff without invoking, applying, or observing a native write; for a new fact use memory-new, and for a past decision use decision-recall. Use when the user says: memory-sync, memory curation, memory review, memory inspect, memory check, memory update, context cleanup, curate memory.

# Memory Sync

This is a Hermes-native `memory-sync` workflow skill.

## Why This Exists

`memory-sync` exists so Hermes users can ask for this workflow in chat and receive a structured, evidence-bounded OMH operating surface instead of ad hoc narration.

## Do Not Use When

- The request is already handled by a narrower explicit skill with stronger evidence.
- The user asks OMH to secretly run external platforms, connectors, schedulers, file exports, or runtime agents.
- The only safe answer is to ask for missing authority, credentials, target, or observed evidence first.

## Examples

Good example:

- Prompt: memory-sync inspect stale MEMORY.md claims, prepare a native write diff, and ask which claims to keep, revise, or archive.
- Expected behavior: Produce `prepare_memory_sync` with required context, wrapper actions, and not-evidence boundaries.
- Why: The prompt names a real workflow surface that Hermes can orchestrate without hiding execution.

Bad example:

- Prompt: memory-sync claim a prepared native diff changed MEMORY.md or USER.md.
- Expected behavior: Report the missing observed evidence or authority instead of claiming the external step happened.
- Why: Prepared OMH guidance is not platform, runtime, connector, file, memory, or delivery evidence.

## Completion Checklist

- Confirm the workflow target, evidence boundary, and stop condition are named.
- Report which outputs are prepared, observed, blocked, or missing.
- Name the smallest next verification or handoff instead of claiming completion from narration.

## Recovery Notes

- If required context is missing, ask one blocking question or route back to the narrower workflow.
- If runtime or wrapper evidence is unavailable, keep the status as not_observed and expose the next observable action.

## Workflow Lane

- Current lane: **Retained knowledge** (`memory-new`, `memory-sync`, `decision-recall`, `wiki`) - memory, rejected alternatives, wiki notes, retrieval, and staleness.
- If intent belongs to another lane, hand back to `oh-my-hermes` or name the adjacent workflow.
- Shared product, routing, compatibility, and evidence rules: `omh-routing/references/skill-common-rail.md`.

## English-Canonical Interview Protocol

- **Claim extraction (추출)** - Break supplied `USER.md` and `MEMORY.md` material into claims. Quote only observed claims; never invent provenance.
- **Provenance (출처)** - Ask for the source class and distinguish Hermes-native, provider, and vector material as `not_omh_reviewed`.
- **Target (대상)** - Review existing native-memory claims only. Route a new project/product fact to `memory-new`.
- **Review (검토)** - Prioritize stale, conflicting, duplicate, and overgeneralized claims. Offer keep, revise, or archive choices; do not describe an archive as removal.
- **Diff (차이)** - Prepare one concise native write diff with before/after claims and counts. Keep the caps: MEMORY.md about 2,200 characters and USER.md about 1,375 characters.
- **Native-write boundary (쓰기)** - This skill can prepare guidance and a native write diff only. It never invokes, applies, or observes a `MEMORY.md`/`USER.md` write.

## Memory Boundaries

The prepared artifact is `memory_curation_review/v1`, not native-memory mutation evidence. Hermes-native and external provider/vector context is `not_omh_reviewed`: it can nominate an OMH candidate but never inherits OMH approval. A configured Hermes runtime may transmit rendered OMH prefetch content in its model request.

Use lifecycle words literally: expire removes influence only; retire archives recoverably; restore creates a new pending revision while preserving the archive; prune hard-deletes only the manifest-declared OMH-local target set. Report restore and prune first. No lifecycle result proves anything outside that named local target set.

Legacy v1 material is migration/review-required. Present `memory inventory` counts and the report-first per-artifact `memory reactivate ... --apply` path; inventory and reactivation never silently grant replay eligibility. Dreaming remains reminder-only: it prepares reminders for `stale_review_required` and `expired_volatile_records`, never consolidation, retirement, restore, or prune.

Normal users use natural-language Hermes chat. `omh memory ...` commands are agent/operator control-plane references, not normal-user setup.

## Use When

Use when existing Hermes USER.md, MEMORY.md, or accumulated skill memories need an English-canonical, claim-by-claim review. It prepares native write guidance only; it never invokes, applies, or observes a native write. Do not use for new project or product candidates.

    Strong routing signals: `memory-sync`, `memory curation`, `memory review`, `memory inspect`, `memory check`, `memory update`, `context cleanup`, `curate memory`, `stale memory`, `hermes remembers`, `conflicting memory`, `duplicate skill`, `MEMORY.md`, `USER.md`, `기억하고 있는`, `기억하고 있는 프로젝트 맥락`, `기억하는 맥락`, `현재 hermes가 기억하는 맥락`, `현재 헤르메스가 기억하는 맥락`, `헤르메스가 기억하는 맥락`, `오래된 맥락`, `오래된 기억`, `기억 점검`, `기억 정리`, `메모리 업데이트`, `메모리 검사`, `메모리 점검`, `메모리 정리`, `맥락 점검`, `맥락 정리`, `맥락 피드백`, `등록된 맥락`, `헤르메스 기억`, `중복 스킬`, `나에 대해 잘못 알고`, `저장된 내 정보`, `너한테 저장된`, `저장된 프로필`, `기억 바로잡`, `what you remember about me`, `your memory about me`

## Catalog Metadata

Category: `memory`
Phase: `curation-review`
Hermes role: `memory-keeper`
Quality tier: `workflow-surface-gated`
Reasoning demand: `light`

Quality bar:

- Name the user-facing workflow objective, required context, next action, and stop condition.
- Separate prepared guidance from observed platform, runtime, connector, file, memory, or delivery evidence.
- Expose missing tools, credentials, targets, or observations as user-visible gaps.
- State that Hermes-native and external provider/vector context is not_omh_reviewed, can nominate a candidate only, and may receive rendered OMH prefetch content through a configured Hermes runtime model request.

Handoff policy:

Keep this as Hermes-facing orchestration guidance first. Prepare executor, connector, gateway, or host-runtime handoff only when the user accepts that next step and observed evidence can be recorded.

Required inputs:

- user request
- target context
- delivery or status expectation
- known missing evidence

Expected outputs:

- memory-sync/v1 card or guidance
- next action
- prepared-vs-observed boundary

Artifact expectations:

- memory-sync/v1 metadata-only runtime or wrapper card when recorded

Safety rules:

- A memory-sync review is prompt guidance only. It can prepare a native MEMORY.md or USER.md write diff but never invokes, applies, or observes that write. Hermes-native and external provider/vector context is not_omh_reviewed and never inherits OMH approval.
- Do not claim connector, gateway, runtime, file generation, memory mutation, or host automation evidence from prepared guidance.
- Keep English as the canonical protocol; Korean routing triggers and concise Korean help labels remain available.
- Quote claims only when observed, do not invent provenance, and keep the prepared native diff separate from any native write.

## Runtime Evidence

Preferred harness for this skill: `memory-sync`.

```sh
omh runtime record --skill memory-sync --harness memory-sync --status started
```

Record observed delegation results; otherwise return `not_available` or `not_observed`.
Prepared OMH routing is not execution, review, CI, merge-readiness, or merge evidence.
- Treat wrapper memory/context summaries as advisory local context, not proof of opaque Hermes memory reads or changes.
Preserve workflow intent and stop conditions; verify before claiming completion.

Use Hermes-native subagent/delegation features when available: native subagents -> Hermes delegation when available, otherwise sequential lanes.

Shared product, compatibility, topology, memory, harness, and execution rules: `omh-routing/references/skill-common-rail.md`. Load it when applicable; otherwise name an unavailable capability.
