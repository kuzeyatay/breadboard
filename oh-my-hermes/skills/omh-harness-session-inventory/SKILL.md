# Harness Session Inventory

This is a Hermes-native `harness-session-inventory` workflow skill.

## Why This Exists

`harness-session-inventory` exists so Hermes users can ask for this workflow in chat and receive a structured, evidence-bounded OMH operating surface instead of ad hoc narration.

## Do Not Use When

- The request is already handled by a narrower explicit skill with stronger evidence.
- The user asks OMH to secretly run external platforms, connectors, schedulers, file exports, or runtime agents.
- The only safe answer is to ask for missing authority, credentials, target, or observed evidence first.

## Examples

Good example:

- Prompt: harness-session-inventory compare Codex, Claude Code, Hermes, MCP configs, and worktrees for drift before we dispatch agents.
- Expected behavior: Produce `prepare_harness_session_inventory` with required context, wrapper actions, and not-evidence boundaries.
- Why: The prompt names a real workflow surface that Hermes can orchestrate without hiding execution.

Bad example:

- Prompt: harness-session-inventory claim every MCP host loaded and every agent session is healthy from config files alone.
- Expected behavior: Report the missing observed evidence or authority instead of claiming the external step happened.
- Why: Prepared OMH guidance is not platform, runtime, connector, file, memory, or delivery evidence.

## Completion Checklist

- The inventory scope names the harnesses, sessions, MCP hosts, connector configs, and worktrees being compared.
- Prepared, observed, missing, stale, and drifted entries are separated before any health or progress claim.
- The next action says whether to load a host, verify a connector, inspect a worktree, dispatch an executor, or stay blocked.

## Recovery Notes

- If config sources are unavailable, report only the discovered surfaces and mark the missing hosts not_observed.
- If cleanup, host load, connector execution, or session progress is requested, route to the owning workflow instead of folding it into inventory.

## Workflow Lane

- Current lane: **Automation and status** (`achievements`, `workspace-audit`, `production-audit`, `automation-blueprint`, `github-event-ops`, `agent-board`, `gateway-intent-card`, `voice-operator`, `+33 more`) - schedules, status, health, and ops review.
- If intent belongs to another lane, hand back to `oh-my-hermes` or name the adjacent workflow.
- Shared product, routing, compatibility, and evidence rules: `omh-routing/references/skill-common-rail.md`.

## Use When

Use when operators need a cross-harness/session/MCP/worktree inventory and drift summary before claiming any host loaded, connector ran, or agent session progressed.

    Strong routing signals: `harness-session-inventory`, `harness session inventory`, `session inventory`, `session adapter`, `session adapters`, `harness sessions`, `mcp inventory`, `mcp config inventory`, `mcp drift`, `harness drift`, `connector drift`, `worktree inventory`, `worktree lifecycle`, `operator inventory`, `control pane inventory`, `codex session inventory`, `claude code session inventory`, `find previous coding session`, `recover coding session`, `previous codex coding session`, `coding session recall`, `세션 인벤토리`, `지난 코딩 세션`, `코딩 세션 복구`, `세션 기억 복구`, `하네스 세션`, `하네스 드리프트`, `MCP 인벤토리`, `MCP 설정 드리프트`, `워크트리 인벤토리`, `커넥터 드리프트`

Category: `observability`
Phase: `harness-session-inventory`
Hermes role: `tracker`
Quality tier: `workflow-surface-gated`
Reasoning demand: `standard`

Quality bar:

- Name the user-facing workflow objective, required context, next action, and stop condition.
- Separate prepared guidance from observed platform, runtime, connector, file, memory, or delivery evidence.
- Expose missing tools, credentials, targets, or observations as user-visible gaps.

Handoff policy:

Keep this as Hermes-facing orchestration guidance first. Prepare executor, connector, gateway, or host-runtime handoff only when the user accepts that next step and observed evidence can be recorded.

Required inputs:

- user request
- target context
- delivery or status expectation
- known missing evidence

Expected outputs:

- harness_session_inventory/v1 card or guidance
- harness_session_adapter_matrix/v1
- mcp_inventory_drift_report/v1
- worktree_lifecycle_snapshot/v1
- session_progress_slots/v1
- next action
- prepared-vs-observed boundary

Artifact expectations:

- harness_session_inventory/v1 metadata-only runtime or wrapper card when recorded
- harness_session_adapter_matrix/v1 with observed, prepared, missing, and stale adapters
- mcp_inventory_drift_report/v1 with secret-redacted config/source drift only
- worktree_lifecycle_snapshot/v1 with merge-conflict and cleanup candidates when observed

Safety rules:

- A harness session inventory is not host load, MCP tool-call, connector availability, executor dispatch, worktree cleanup, merge-conflict resolution, or session progress evidence.
- Do not claim connector, gateway, runtime, file generation, memory mutation, or host automation evidence from prepared guidance.

## Runtime Evidence

Preferred harness for this skill: `harness-session-inventory`.

```sh
omh runtime record --skill harness-session-inventory --harness harness-session-inventory --status started
```

Record observed delegation results; otherwise return `not_available` or `not_observed`.
Prepared OMH routing is not execution, review, CI, merge-readiness, or merge evidence.
- Treat wrapper memory/context summaries as advisory local context, not proof of opaque Hermes memory reads or changes.
Preserve workflow intent and stop conditions; verify before claiming completion.

Use Hermes-native subagent/delegation features when available: native subagents -> Hermes delegation when available, otherwise sequential lanes.

Shared product, compatibility, topology, memory, harness, and execution rules: `omh-routing/references/skill-common-rail.md`. Load it when applicable; otherwise name an unavailable capability.
