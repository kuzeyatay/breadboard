# Curriculum Design

This is a Hermes-native `curriculum-design` workflow skill.

## Why This Exists

`curriculum-design` makes instructional outcomes, sequence, assessment, and learner constraints reviewable before materials, LMS, or grading work.

## Do Not Use When

- The user wants an explanation of a supplied academic paper rather than a teachable sequence; use `paper-learning`.
- The user needs a deck, workbook, PDF, or other exported learning artifact; route packaging to `materials-package` after the curriculum is accepted.
- The user asks to create or publish an LMS course, enroll students, grade work, or change course settings; use `connector-operator` with explicit authorization and observed evidence.
- The user needs only a short rewrite or one isolated worksheet prompt, not curriculum structure; use `content-operator`.

## Examples

Good example:

- Prompt: Design a six-week onboarding curriculum with learning objectives and practical assessments for new support agents.
- Expected behavior: Prepare learner constraints, scope and sequence, learning objectives, assessments, and adaptation questions.
- Why: The request needs a teachable sequence and assessment plan rather than an LMS course or exported material.

Bad example:

- Prompt: Explain the attached machine-learning paper for a beginner.
- Expected behavior: Route to `paper-learning`, not `curriculum-design`.
- Why: A supplied paper explanation is not a curriculum-design request.

## Completion Checklist

- The plan names goals, non-goals, assumptions, acceptance criteria, and verification shape.
- Draft recommendations, accepted decisions, and executor handoffs are separate states.
- Rejected options or unresolved tradeoffs are recorded before handoff.

## Recovery Notes

- If acceptance criteria or verification are missing, route back to clarification before handoff.
- If assumptions materially affect the plan, keep them visible and avoid treating the plan as accepted.

## Workflow Lane

- Current lane: **Research and company ops** (`source-finder`, `research`, `best-practice-research`, `autoresearch-goal`, `research-brief`, `strategy-brief`, `feedback-triage`, `research-department`, `+12 more`) - research, signals, ops, and briefings.
- If intent belongs to another lane, hand back to `oh-my-hermes` or name the adjacent workflow.
- Shared product, routing, compatibility, and evidence rules: `omh-routing/references/skill-common-rail.md`.

## Use When

Use when an educator or enablement owner needs outcomes, scope and sequence, lesson/module design, assessment criteria, and differentiation assumptions.

    Strong routing signals: `curriculum design`, `learning objectives`, `assessment plan`, `커리큘럼 설계`, `학습 목표`, `평가 계획`

Category: `planning`
Phase: `curriculum-design`
Hermes role: `planner`
Quality tier: `planning-gated`
Reasoning demand: `standard`

Quality bar:

- Tie outcomes to scope, sequence, activities, assessments, and completion evidence.
- Keep instructional design distinct from exported materials or LMS actions.

Handoff policy:

Keep domain framing, clarification, source/evidence synthesis, draft outputs, and next-work routing in Hermes. A prepared brief, review, reply, or plan is not an external action, approval, filing, send, publish, data mutation, implementation, review, CI, or merge claim. Prepare a connector, file, coding, or human-review handoff only when the user explicitly accepts that next step; report it only from observed evidence. Hermes designs an instructional plan; it does not create an LMS course, enroll learners, grade submissions, certify learning, publish materials, or claim learning outcomes occurred.

Required inputs:

- learners
- learning goal
- prerequisites
- constraints

Expert clarification questions:
- `learners`
  - English: Who are the learners this curriculum should serve?
  - Korean: 이 커리큘럼의 대상 학습자는 누구인가요?

Expected outputs:

- learner/audience, prerequisite, outcome, and constraint brief
- scope-and-sequence with modules/lessons and activity rationale
- formative/summative assessment rubric and completion evidence
- accessibility, adaptation, and source/rights questions plus next route

Artifact expectations:

- prepared curriculum design brief when a wrapper captures it

Safety rules:

- Make learner prerequisites, accessibility, adaptation, and source-rights gaps explicit.
- Do not claim LMS mutation, enrollment, grading, certification, publication, or learning outcomes.

## Runtime Evidence

Preferred harness for this skill: `planning`.

```sh
omh runtime record --skill curriculum-design --harness planning --status started
```

Record observed delegation results; otherwise return `not_available` or `not_observed`.
Prepared OMH routing is not execution, review, CI, merge-readiness, or merge evidence.
- Treat wrapper memory/context summaries as advisory local context, not proof of opaque Hermes memory reads or changes.
Preserve workflow intent and stop conditions; verify before claiming completion.

Use Hermes-native subagent/delegation features when available: native subagents -> Hermes delegation when available, otherwise sequential lanes.

Shared product, compatibility, topology, memory, harness, and execution rules: `omh-routing/references/skill-common-rail.md`. Load it when applicable; otherwise name an unavailable capability.
