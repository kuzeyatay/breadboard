# Loop

This is a Hermes-native `loop` workflow skill.

## Why This Exists

`loop` exists for goals whose correct implementation cannot be known upfront but can be discovered through bounded cycles of definition, action, verification, and revision without confusing planned cycles with observed progress.

## Do Not Use When

- The user asks for one bounded delivery cycle; use `ultraprocess` or `ultragoal` instead.
- Scope and milestones are already known and only durable checkpoint/resume tracking is needed; use `ultragoal`.
- The user gives only a north-star outcome such as revenue, stars, or adoption and has not accepted a bounded first loop goal.
- The goal is too vague to name an observable problem, next artifact, verification signal, or stop condition.
- The goal depends mainly on external waiting, adoption, revenue, or community response without observable local next actions.
- The permission profile does not allow repeated research, handoff, queue, or feedback cycles.

## Examples

Good example:

- Prompt: ./loop make OMH a credible Hermes workflow pack with install, docs, QA, and feedback cycles.
- Expected behavior: Start a permission-scoped loop, maintain loop_cycle/v1 state, choose the next concrete task, and keep external outcomes as waiting states.
- Why: The request is long-horizon and needs repeated discovery, verification, feedback, and resume decisions.

Bad example:

- Prompt: ./loop merge this already reviewed one-line README fix.
- Expected behavior: Use a direct delivery or PR workflow instead of starting a persistent loop.
- Why: The task is bounded and should stop after merge evidence rather than create ongoing cycles.

## Completion Checklist

- The request is classified as task, project, north-star ambition, external-wait, or unclear before a loop starts.
- The current loop_status_card/v1 names the queue item, tick status, verification_plan, and next action.
- failure_mode_summary checks verification_gap, comprehension_debt, and cognitive_surrender before progress advances.
- Completion is backed by linked goal/runtime evidence; queued loop ticks alone are not observed work.

## Recovery Notes

- If a queued tick is pending, show it as prepared queue state and use loop status/run-once before claiming progress.
- If feedback is unclear, ask one gate question or route back to research/plan rather than advancing the loop.
- If the goal turns into external waiting, record the waiting state and next observable signal instead of continuing locally.
- If context or budget is exhausted, checkpoint the loop artifact and continue from the latest loop_cycle/v1 state.

## Workflow Lane

- Current lane: **Intent -> plan** (`oh-my-hermes`, `meta-router`, `deep-interview`, `plan`, `ralplan`, `codebase-onboarding`, `codegraph-refresh`, `ultragoal`, `+6 more`) - clarify, plan, ship, or loop goals.
- If intent belongs to another lane, hand back to `oh-my-hermes` or name the adjacent workflow.

## Use When

Use when the user starts a high-level goal or invokes loop. Direct loop invocation means start/continue through interviewer, planner, researcher, builder, reviewer, and loop-controller lanes until a real gate stops it.

    Strong routing signals: `loop`, `./loop`, `$loop`, `goal loop`, `long horizon goal`, `never stop`, `research plan ultragoal feedback`, `token exhaustion resume`, `permission profile`, `star 10k`, `10k star`, `loop engineering`, `루프`, `목표 루프`, `장기 목표`, `끝까지`, `토큰 고갈`, `피드백 루프`, `끝날 때까지 계속`, `계속 돌려줘`, `keep running until done`

Quality tier: `loop-gated`
Reasoning demand: `heavy`

Quality bar:

- Treat direct `loop`, `./loop`, `$loop`, and OMH loop invocations as a start/continue signal rather than a picker or passive clarification path.
- Classify the goal as task, project, ambition, external-wait, or unclear inside the loop, then keep progressing until a real permission, evidence, verification, context, budget, or external-wait gate appears.
- Expose core OMH roles: interviewer, planner, researcher, builder, reviewer, and loop controller.
- Route tiny direct tasks to one-cycle delivery surfaces instead of forcing loop overhead.
- Reframe a north-star ambition into a bounded arena, observable problem, next loop goal, and next verification without shrinking its ambition.
- Separate task discovery, distribution, execution, verification, next-task decision, runtime tick queueing, ultragoal/handoff, feedback, waiting, and resume decisions.
- Expose a permission profile before executor/runtime dispatch, repository mutation, PR, merge, or external publishing.
- Expose the automation, worktree, skill, connector, and subagent building-block states without treating planned blocks as observed work.
- Choose workflow patterns such as single-step, fan-out-and-synthesize, adversarial verification, tournament, or triage batch as orchestration metadata only.
- Keep repeated scaffold shape stable, summarize within bounded budgets, and add verifier lanes only when risk or evidence warrants them.
- Keep prepared worktree/subagent/connector plans, observed executor work, linked goal completion, and external waiting as distinct evidence states.
- Use cheap inner-loop checks frequently and expensive outer-loop checks sparingly.
- Keep the practical small-loop recipe visible: test as stop signal, plan -> execute -> verify, one task at a time.
- Surface verification_gap, comprehension_debt, and cognitive_surrender as warnings before a loop starts looking self-steering.

Handoff policy:

Keep loop orchestration, role sequencing, verification-tier selection, deterministic runtime ticks, loop_engineering/v1 status, feedback evaluation, and permission narration in Hermes; prepare executor/runtime/worktree/connector/verifier handoffs only for concrete work and record completion only from linked evidence.

Required inputs:

- loopability assessment
- north-star goal summary when present
- bounded arena
- observable problem
- next verification
- goal reframe
- success criteria
- permission profile
- feedback or wait signal

Expected outputs:

- loopability_assessment/v1 task/project/ambition classification
- loop_start_card/v1 setup prompt
- loop_cycle/v1 state
- loop_engineering/v1 pipeline/building-block snapshot
- loop verification_policy for inner/outer checks
- loop failure_mode_summary over verification gap, comprehension debt, and cognitive surrender
- small-loop guidance: test as stop signal, plan -> execute -> verify, one task at a time
- loop_status_card/v1 next action
- loop_runtime/v1 queued tick with verification_plan refs
- loop_queue_handoff/v1 only when permitted
- executor-neutral handoff only when permitted
- external-wait or checkpoint boundary

Artifact expectations:

- metadata-only .omh/loops loop_cycle/v1 artifact with loopability_assessment/v1
- loop_engineering/v1 status over automation, worktree, skill, connector, subagent, verification policy, and failure modes
- loop_runtime/v1 queue entries with context_policy_ref, cost_policy_ref, and verification_plan
- loop_subagent_result_contract/v1 for prepared subagent handoffs
- loop_status_card/v1 wrapper payload with loopability_assessment, failure_mode_summary, and small_loop_guidance
- loop_start_card/v1 wrapper setup card
- linked goal_ledger/v1 only when completion evidence is required

Safety rules:

- Do not treat loop persistence as permission to bypass the selected permission profile.
- Do not treat a runtime tick as worktree creation, subagent dispatch, connector I/O, implementation, review, CI, merge, publication, or completion evidence.
- Do not claim goal completion from loop state; require linked goal_ledger/v1 completion evidence.
- When context or token budget runs out, checkpoint or rely on resumable state instead of pretending the loop is complete.
- External results such as market response, stars, or adoption are waiting states unless observed evidence is supplied.
- Do not let unattended loop progress bypass verification; missing or failed verification returns to plan/research or waits for evidence.
- Do not let comprehension debt or cognitive surrender hide behind green-looking loop status.

## Runtime Evidence

Preferred harness for this skill: `goal-loop`.

```sh
omh runtime record --skill loop --harness goal-loop --status started
```

Record observed delegation results; otherwise return `not_available` or `not_observed`.
Prepared OMH routing is not execution, review, CI, merge-readiness, or merge evidence.
- When wrapper metadata includes `memory_review_card/v1` or `handoff_context_pack/v1`, treat it as reviewed OMH-local or wrapper-supplied context only. Use conflict-free context summaries to shape plans and handoffs, but do not claim Hermes internal memory was read or changed.
Preserve workflow intent and stop conditions; verify before claiming completion.

Use Hermes-native subagent/delegation features when available: native subagents -> Hermes delegation when available, otherwise sequential lanes.

Shared product, compatibility, topology, memory, harness, and execution rules: `omh-routing/references/skill-common-rail.md`. Load it when applicable; otherwise name an unavailable capability.
