# Automation Blueprint

This is a Hermes-native `automation-blueprint` workflow skill.

## Why This Exists

`automation-blueprint` exists so Hermes can make recurring operational work feel native and scheduled without OMH becoming a hidden cron runner, transport bot, source retriever, or executor.

## Do Not Use When

- The user needs a one-off report or deck; use `report-package` or `materials-package`.
- The user asks to review incident metrics once; use `reliability-review`.
- The user needs actual code changes; prepare a selected executor/runtime handoff after the blueprint or plan is accepted.

## Examples

Good example:

- Prompt: automation-blueprint every weekday run an uptime check and send a Slack digest only if status changes.
- Expected behavior: Prepare hermes_ops_blueprint/v1 with schedule intent, Slack delivery policy, silence rule, research/report skills, missing evidence, and next confirmation.
- Why: The request is recurring, delivery-shaped, and must stay prepared until host automation and gateway delivery are observed.

Bad example:

- Prompt: automation-blueprint prove the Slack digest was delivered this morning.
- Expected behavior: Ask for observed Hermes/gateway delivery evidence or report the delivery as not_observed instead of claiming it happened.
- Why: A blueprint can prepare the scheduled operation, but it cannot prove runtime execution or delivery.

## Completion Checklist

- Confirm the workflow target, evidence boundary, and stop condition are named.
- Report which outputs are prepared, observed, blocked, or missing.
- Name the smallest next verification or handoff instead of claiming completion from narration.

## Recovery Notes

- If required context is missing, ask one blocking question or route back to the narrower workflow.
- If runtime or wrapper evidence is unavailable, keep the status as not_observed and expose the next observable action.

## Workflow Lane

- Current lane: **Automation and status** (`achievements`, `workspace-audit`, `production-audit`, `automation-blueprint`, `github-event-ops`, `agent-board`, `gateway-intent-card`, `voice-operator`, `+33 more`) - schedules, status, health, and ops review.
- If intent belongs to another lane, hand back to `oh-my-hermes` or name the adjacent workflow.
- Shared product, routing, compatibility, and evidence rules: `omh-routing/references/skill-common-rail.md`.

## Use When

Use when Hermes should turn a natural recurring/cron-like request into a scheduled ops blueprint without claiming host automation, platform delivery, source retrieval, or no-agent execution.

    Strong routing signals: `automation-blueprint`, `scheduled ops`, `scheduled operation`, `scheduled operations`, `automation blueprint`, `cron blueprint`, `cron-ready`, `recurring ops`, `recurring workflow`, `every morning`, `every day`, `daily digest`, `weekly digest`, `automate this`, `automate workflow`, `send to slack`, `send to discord`, `post to telegram`, `only if changed`, `silent if nothing changed`, `schedule this`, `매일`, `매주`, `정기`, `예약`, `반복`, `자동화`, `자동화해줘`, `스케줄`, `슬랙`, `디스코드`, `텔레그램`, `보내`, `공유`, `변화 없으면`, `조용히`

## Catalog Metadata

Category: `operations`
Phase: `scheduled-ops-blueprint`
Hermes role: `operator`
Quality tier: `ops-blueprint-gated`
Reasoning demand: `light`

Quality bar:

- Name cadence/timezone uncertainty, delivery target, silence/no-change rule, selected skills, and context chain.
- Expose whether a no-agent watchdog is a candidate without claiming it exists or ran.
- List host automation, gateway delivery, source retrieval, and no-agent execution as not evidence until observed.

Handoff policy:

Keep schedule intent, delivery policy, silence rules, context-chain selection, and status narration in Hermes; prepare host automation or no-agent follow-up only after an operator/wrapper records observed runtime evidence.

Required inputs:

- recurring request
- schedule or cadence hint
- delivery target or current-thread default
- silence/no-change preference

Expected outputs:

- hermes_ops_blueprint/v1 projection
- schedule/delivery/silence confirmation needs
- status-card boundary
- not-evidence list

Artifact expectations:

- hermes_ops_blueprint/v1 under .omh/hermes-ops/blueprints when a wrapper or CLI records it

Safety rules:

- Do not claim host cron, Hermes automation, gateway delivery, source retrieval, no-agent execution, plugin load, or connector work from a prepared blueprint.
- Keep scheduled operations as projection metadata until the host runtime supplies observed evidence.
- Route later coding, material generation, or report delivery into separate accepted handoffs when needed.

## Runtime Evidence

Preferred harness for this skill: `scheduled-ops-blueprint`.

```sh
omh runtime record --skill automation-blueprint --harness scheduled-ops-blueprint --status started
```

Record observed delegation results; otherwise return `not_available` or `not_observed`.
Prepared OMH routing is not execution, review, CI, merge-readiness, or merge evidence.
- Treat wrapper memory/context summaries as advisory local context, not proof of opaque Hermes memory reads or changes.
Preserve workflow intent and stop conditions; verify before claiming completion.

Use Hermes-native subagent/delegation features when available: native subagents -> Hermes delegation when available, otherwise sequential lanes.

Shared product, compatibility, topology, memory, harness, and execution rules: `omh-routing/references/skill-common-rail.md`. Load it when applicable; otherwise name an unavailable capability.
