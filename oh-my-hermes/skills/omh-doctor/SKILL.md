# Doctor

This is a Hermes-native `doctor` workflow skill.

## Why This Exists

`doctor` exists to turn confusing install/setup states into grouped, local health evidence and the next repair action without treating a check as a fix.

## Do Not Use When

- The user is asking for a general product explanation rather than local health diagnostics.
- The requested change is a repository bug fix, not an installed-environment check.
- The wrapper wants to claim Hermes reload, skill execution, or plugin behavior that was not observed.

## Examples

Good example:

- Prompt: doctor after omh update says setup is next but Hermes skills still look stale.
- Expected behavior: Inspect managed skills, Hermes registration, runtime state, and next repair action with explicit proof boundaries.
- Why: The issue is local installation health and needs grouped diagnostic evidence.

Bad example:

- Prompt: doctor implement a new uninstall command UX.
- Expected behavior: Route to planning or implementation instead of health diagnostics.
- Why: That is product development work, not a local health check.

## Completion Checklist

- Command availability, managed skills, Hermes registration, runtime state, and optional surfaces are grouped separately.
- Blocking issues and warnings are separated, with one next repair action named for each blocking area.
- Plugin install, plugin import/register smoke, and Hermes runtime load are not collapsed into one claim.
- The final status says whether setup/update/doctor repaired anything or only observed health.

## Recovery Notes

- If managed skills are stale, recommend omh update or omh setup depending on whether registration also needs repair.
- If skills.external_dirs or Hermes config is missing, route to setup repair rather than editing hidden runtime state.
- If plugin register smoke fails, reinstall the plugin bundle with setup --with-plugin --force before claiming plugin readiness.
- If omh is missing from PATH, use the installer-reported absolute command path and then re-run doctor.

## Workflow Lane

- Current lane: **Automation and status** (`achievements`, `workspace-audit`, `production-audit`, `automation-blueprint`, `github-event-ops`, `agent-board`, `gateway-intent-card`, `voice-operator`, `+33 more`) - schedules, status, health, and ops review.
- If intent belongs to another lane, hand back to `oh-my-hermes` or name the adjacent workflow.
- Shared product, routing, compatibility, and evidence rules: `omh-routing/references/skill-common-rail.md`.

## Use When

Use to diagnose OMH installation and Hermes config registration.

    Strong routing signals: `doctor`, `$doctor`, `diagnose omh`, `installation health`

## Catalog Metadata

Category: `operator`
Phase: `diagnostics`
Hermes role: `tracker`
Quality tier: `evidence-gated`
Reasoning demand: `light`

Quality bar:

- Name the workflow target, constraints, validation evidence, and stop condition.
- Separate Hermes guidance from executor or wrapper behavior unless evidence proves the step happened.

Handoff policy:

Run directly as local health inspection; propose executor work only when a repo fix is required.

Required inputs:

- omh home
- Hermes home
- observed issue

Expected outputs:

- health checks
- fix guidance
- known proof boundary

Artifact expectations:

- doctor state summary when runtime artifacts are writable

Safety rules:

- Do not imply hidden Hermes runtime behavior.
- Use the smallest verification that can prove the claim.

## Runtime Evidence

Preferred harness for this skill: `qa-specialist`.

```sh
omh runtime record --skill doctor --harness qa-specialist --status started
```

Record observed delegation results; otherwise return `not_available` or `not_observed`.
Prepared OMH routing is not execution, review, CI, merge-readiness, or merge evidence.
- Treat wrapper memory/context summaries as advisory local context, not proof of opaque Hermes memory reads or changes.
Preserve workflow intent and stop conditions; verify before claiming completion.

Use Hermes-native subagent/delegation features when available: native subagents -> Hermes delegation when available, otherwise sequential lanes.

Shared product, compatibility, topology, memory, harness, and execution rules: `omh-routing/references/skill-common-rail.md`. Load it when applicable; otherwise name an unavailable capability.
